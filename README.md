# Meta Tag Bag

A class for collecting HTML meta tags.
Works well with Laravel, and without.

## Development & Testing

`composer test` from the project directory will run the default test suite.

If you want your own local configuration for phpunit,
copy the file `phpunit.xml.dist` to `phpunit.xml` and modify the latter to your needs.
